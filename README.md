A tiling window manager for Microsoft Windows

There are many brilliant tiling window managers available for X. Options available for Microsoft Windows aren't quite as good.
This project is an attempt to fix that.

The goal of this project is to make a polished and featureful tiling window manager that just works.

Installation
============

Just download [Paneless.zip](https://github.com/TomPeters/paneless/blob/master/build/Paneless.zip?raw=true) and extract to any location.

Usage
=====

Run Paneless.exe. An icon will appear in your system tray to indicate that paneless is running. 

Press Control + Windows + T to tile all active windows. Press this combination again at any time to re-tile your windows.

To exit, right click on the system tray icon and click exit.

If you find any bugs or discover any applications that are not being tiled correctly, please report them so they can be fixed!

~~Contributions are very welcome, just fork and submit a pull request. 
The general infrastructure is in its easly stages and is still evolving rapidly with every commit. Once it matures a bit more it will be easier to pick a feature to hack on.

~~I will try to keep the Github issues tracker up to date to reflect the immediate project direction so you can find appropriate tasks and discuss them there.

~~I am more than happy to discuss the project in detail or help out anyone who wishes to contribute. Just contact me at tom@tjpeters.net
